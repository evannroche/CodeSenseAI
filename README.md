Python Code Analyzer
A web-based tool that provides static analysis of Python code to help developers improve code quality, maintainability, and security.

‚öôÔ∏è Key Features
Comprehensive Code Analysis: Parses Python code using the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to generate detailed metrics like Cyclomatic Complexity, function counts, and line statistics.

Actionable Issue Detection: Automatically flags potential code quality issues such as overly complex functions, missing docstrings, and bare except blocks.

Security Vulnerability Scanning: Identifies common security risks, including hardcoded secrets (e.g., API keys) and dangerous function calls (eval, exec).

Intuitive User Interface: Offers a clean, responsive front-end where users can either upload .py files or paste code snippets for instant analysis.
